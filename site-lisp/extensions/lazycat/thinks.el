;;; Commentary:

;; thinks.el is a little bit of silliness inspired by the think bubbles you
;; see in cartoons. It allows you to
;;
;; . o O ( insert text that looks like this )
;;
;; into a buffer. This could possibly be handy for use in email and usenet
;; postings.
;;
;; Note that the code can handle multiple lines
;;
;; . o O ( like this. That is, a body of text where the number of characters )
;;       ( exceeds the bounds of what you might consider to be a acceptable  )
;;       ( line length (he says, waffling on to fill a couple of lines).     )
;;
;; You can also control how the bubble looks with `thinks-from'. The above
;; had it set to `top'. You can have `middle':
;;
;;       ( like this. That is, a body of text where the number of characters )
;; . o O ( exceeds the bounds of what you might consider to be a acceptable  )
;;       ( line length (he says, waffling on to fill a couple of lines).     )
;;
;; `bottom':
;;
;;       ( like this. That is, a body of text where the number of characters )
;;       ( exceeds the bounds of what you might consider to be a acceptable  )

;; and `bottom-diagonal':

;;       ( line length (he says, waffling on to fill a couple of lines).     )
;;     O
;;   o
;; .
;;
;; By default all of the thinking functions will fill (word wrap) the text
;; taking into account the value of `fill-column' minus the space required
;; for the bubble. Prefix a call to any of the functions with C-u to turn
;; off this behaviour.

;;; Thanks:

;; Special thanks go to Gareth Owen for being barmy enough to be (as far as
;; we know) the first person to post to Usenet using thinks.el. If not the
;; first posting to Usenet at least the first posting to gnu.emacs.soruces.
;;
;; Thanks also go to Gareth for inspiring the extra-silliness option.
;;
;; Thanks to Jason Rumney for suggesting the diagonal option.
;;
;; Thanks to Martin Blais for `thinks-maybe-region'.
